## gateway-rs configuration file

## Keypair is a string that supports specifying different locations for 
## the secrets. The default one is file based one since all —É—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–π—Å—Ç–≤–∞ can support it.

# File based: 
keypair = "file:///etc/helium_gateway/gateway_key.bin"

# The address to listen on for the (semtech) packet forwarder
listen = "0.0.0.0:1680"

# The local port to serve the local grpc on. Supports both a simple port number
# or full ip:port listen address. Do NOT expose this port outside of the host
# network for security
